in terminal: 
`npm init -y`

the add this under scripts in package.json:

`   "start": "./node_modules/.bin/http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1",`

then npm start to serve the index page...

since this example has the content moved into wwwroot, use this to start server in terminal:

`C:\workspaces\davidjmcclelland\au-movies\wwwroot>http-server -p 8001`
